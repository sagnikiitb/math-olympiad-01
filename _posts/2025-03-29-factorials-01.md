# Factorials

## Definition
- Definition $factorial(n) := n!; \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}$
- Base Case : $1! = 1$
- Inductive Case : $n! = n \times (n-1)!$

## Points to Pomder
- Can WE assign a value to $0!$ ?
- What about $-1!$, $-2!$, $-0.5!$, $0.5!$, $1.5!$?

## Preliminary Training
 - Question 1a : Write the expression for $NCk$ in terms of factorials.\[2\]
 - Question 1b : Therefore, write the expression for $NC2$. \[2\]
 - Question 2  : (Pg. 15 Problem Primer) For a positive integer n, define
   $A(n)$ to be $$\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}$$
   Determine the sets of positive integer $n$ for which
   - Question 2a : $A(n)$ is an even number \[2\]
   - Question 2b : $A(n)$ is a multiple of $4$ \[2\]
 - Question 3a : Evaluate $100 \times 101 \times 102 \times 103 \times 104 \times 105 (mod 6!)$ \[2\]
 - Question 3b : Evaluate $100 \times 101 \times 102 \times 103 \times 104 \times 105 (mod 5!)$ \[2]\]
 - Question 4a : Is there a natural number $n$ such that $n!$ when written in decimal notation \(base $10$ \) ends in exactly $1993$ zeroes? \[2\]
 - Question 4b : If so, find the number! \[2\]
 - Question 5 : Find the largest integer $k$ for which $2^k$ divides $100!$? \[2\]
 - Question 6 : Find all positive integers $m$ and $n$ \( with $m \geq n$ \) such that
  $$\frac{(m!)}{(n!)} = 720$$ \[2\]
 - Question 7 : Find the non-negative integer\(s\) $x$ satisfying 
  $$\frac{(x+7)!}{(x+3)!} = 5040$$ \[2\]
 - Question 8 : Find a closed-form \(most-simplified-form\) expression for
  $$S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k!(k+1)!}$$ \[2\]
 - Question 9 : $n! > 2^n; \forall n \geq Q; n,Q \in \mathbb{Z}$
  Find $Q$. \[2\]
 - Question 10 : Solve for $n$ if
  $$\frac{n!}{(n-2)!} = 56$$ \[2\]
 - Question 11 : What is the number of zeros at the end of $1000!$ ? \[2\]
 - Question 12 : Find the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ has at least 100 digits \[2\]
 - Question 13 : For $n \geq Q$ the sum
  $$1! + 2! + .. + n!$$
  is never a perfect power, i.e. cannot be written in the form $m^k$ with integers
  $m > 1, k \geq 2$
  Find Q. \[2\]
 - Question 14 : Find all positive integers $n$ such that $n! + 2$ is a perfect square. \[2\]
 - Question 15 : Determind $gcd(n!,(n+1)!)$ for any positive integer $n$ \[2\]
 - Question 16 : Find $(n+1)! - n! (mod n!)$ \[2\]
